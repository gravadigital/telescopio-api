## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

We use a clear, descriptive branching strategy:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code (protected)
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features (protected)
- **`feature/description`**: New features (`feature/quality-assessment-improvements`)
- **`fix/description`**: Bug fixes (`fix/assignment-generation-edge-case`)
- **`docs/description`**: Documentation updates (`docs/api-reference-update`)
- **`refactor/description`**: Code refactoring (`refactor/voting-service-cleanup`)
- **`perf/description`**: Performance improvements (`perf/database-query-optimization`)

### Development Process

1. **Check existing issues** before starting work to avoid duplication

2. **Create or claim an issue** describing what you plan to work on

3. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

5. **Write comprehensive tests** (required for all new features)

6. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs or algorithms

7. **Test thoroughly** - run all tests and verify functionality

8. **Commit** using conventional commit format

9. **Push and create Pull Request** against the `develop` branch

## üíª Coding Standards

### Go Style Guidelines

We follow standard Go conventions plus additional project-specific standards:

#### General Standards
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Pass `go vet` without warnings
- Use meaningful variable names (prefer clarity over brevity)
- Write self-documenting code with clear logic flow
- Handle errors explicitly and appropriately

#### Mathematical Code
- Include references to academic papers in comments
- Use variable names that match mathematical notation when possible
- Document complex algorithms with step-by-step comments
- Include numerical examples in comments for clarity

#### Example:
```go
// CalculateModifiedBordaCount implements the MBC formula from Merrifield & Saari (2009)
// Formula: MBC(f_j) = (1 / m(m-1)) √ó Œ£(m - R_i(f_j))
// where m = attachments per evaluator, R_i(f_j) = rank given to submission f_j by evaluator i
func (vs *VotingService) CalculateModifiedBordaCount(
    eventID uuid.UUID, 
    config *VotingConfiguration,
) (*VotingResults, error) {
    // Implementation with clear variable names matching the formula
    m := config.AttachmentsPerEvaluator // m from the formula
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

#### Project Structure
- Follow the established domain-driven design patterns
- Keep business logic in domain packages
- Use repositories for data access
- Separate HTTP handlers from business logic

#### Database
- Use UUIDs for all primary keys
- Follow GORM conventions
- Write proper database migrations
- Include proper constraints and indexes

func TestCalculateModifiedBordaCount(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        votes    []*Vote
        config   *VotingConfiguration
        expected *VotingResults
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name: "basic MBC calculation with 3 attachments",
            votes: []*Vote{
                // Test data
            },
            config: &VotingConfiguration{
                AttachmentsPerEvaluator: 3,
            },
            expected: &VotingResults{
                // Expected results
            },
            wantErr: false,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {

}
```

## üìö Documentation

### Required Documentation Updates

All public functions must have comprehensive Go doc comments:

```go
// Package vote implements the mathematical models and algorithms
// for distributed voting based on the Modified Borda Count mechanism
// as described in Merrifield & Saari (2009).
//
// The package provides functionality for:
//   - Generating fair assignment distributions
//   - Calculating Modified Borda Count scores
//   - Assessing participant evaluation quality
//   - Implementing incentive mechanisms
package vote

// CalculateQualityAssessment implements the evaluator quality assessment
// algorithm described in Section 4.2 of Merrifield & Saari (2009).
//
// The quality metric Q_i measures how well evaluator i's rankings align
// with the community consensus, calculated as:
//
//   Q_i = 1 - (2/(m(m-1))) √ó Œ£|R_i(f_j) - RelativeRank_G(f_j, A(p_i))|
//
// Parameters:
//   - eventID: UUID of the voting event
//   - globalResults: The community consensus ranking
//   - config: Voting configuration parameters
//
// Returns:
//   - qualityMap: Map of participant UUID to quality score [0,1]
//   - error: Computation errors or validation failures
//
// Quality scores interpretation:
//   - Q_i = 1.0: Perfect alignment with consensus
//   - Q_i = 0.5: Random/average alignment
//   - Q_i = 0.0: Complete opposite of consensus
func CalculateQualityAssessment(
    eventID uuid.UUID,
    globalResults []AttachmentResult,
    config *VotingConfiguration,
) (map[uuid.UUID]float64, error) {
    // Implementation...
}
```
